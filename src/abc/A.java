//abstract methods rules:

//the method TO be abstract should not have a body
//use the keyword call abstract if i am inside the absrtact class
//only abstract class should have abstract method
//can never be private
//it can not be static
//abstract class can inherets another abstract class
//the class can implements multiple interface but we need to add them 
//if you have abstract method we can not have a body {}
